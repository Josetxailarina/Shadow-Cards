## 🛠️ Massive Refactor & Code Cleanup

This repository now contains a **heavily refactored and cleaned-up version** of the original Game Jam code. While the jam version focused on rapid prototyping and core mechanics, this version focuses on **clean architecture**, **maintainability**, and **readability**.

Key improvements:
- 🔄 Simplified and modularized complex scripts into smaller, focused components
- ✍️ Renamed unclear variables and methods for better self-documentation
- 🧹 Removed redundant logic and cleaned up messy code blocks
- 🗂️ Organized scripts into logical folders (Managers, Cards, UI, Gameplay)
- ⚙️ Reviewed the entire codebase to ensure all systems still work as expected

> 💡 *The original Game Jam version remains playable on Itch.io as it was submitted on the final day of development.*
